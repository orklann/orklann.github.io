After reading on Turing Machine and trying to make some turing machines in C
language, I was thinking making some small Turing Machine which don't need to
have electric power to work.

But before I invent those pure natural Turing Machine, I realised I can
understand what computation really is. Computation is just to change something
based on some inputs and some predefined rules (like addition, substration or
other rules not within our universe), and an fantasy idea came out of my mind.
    
Our universe is a combinations of computational things and uncomputational
things. All physical things are computational, and our souls are
uncomputational.

That means all status of physical world are predictable in itself because it's
computational, but because our souls are uncomputational, and can affect the
physical world, so at last the physical world are unpreditable.

But why I think the physical world is computational, because we can make
physical Turing Machine without electric power. And Turing Machine have the
same power of today's computer, and if our universe is a pure physical Turing
Machine(s) made by our gods, then our universe is computational.

"We can decide our fate, because our souls are uncomputational"

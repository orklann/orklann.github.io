<p class="meta">26 May 2021</p>

While working on [PEP](https://macpep.org), an open source PDF editor for Mac. I 
am also working on an open source PDF generation library for Python. The Github 
repo is now private, I will make it public at the right time. 

This library is called Caprice. Yes, it's the same name as the fashion brand. I 
like that brand, so it's the library name.

- I am writting this post in my room after finishing my guitar practice routine.

```python
import os

def introducing_caprice():
    print("Hello, Caprice!")
```

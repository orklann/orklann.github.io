        <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
        
        <p>
            I am working on a free and open source PDF editor for MacOS called PEP (PDF Editing
            Program). It is a lightweight alternative to Adobe Acrobat.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            PEP is still in the very early stages of development, and I am in need of funds to fully focus on it. Ideally, I would like to improve PEP more before 
            requesting donations, but unfortunately because of my living situation I need funds now.
        </p>
        
        
        <p>
            PEP is an ambitious project as it includes its own PDF engine, built from scratch. Therefore PEP will be self-contained and not rely on 
            third-party PDF libraries. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I'm currently focussed on building out this engine, called Gene, which is the core of PEP. It is primarily this component for which I need 
            funding. I have published everything I have so far in the hope that someone will see its potential and donate towards it.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been a Mac developer for about 10 years. You can see some of my commercial Mac apps here:

            If you would find PEP useful and want to help it succeed, please donate at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/aaronelkins" class="red-color">my Patreon</a>
            to speed up the development process. Alternatively, you can follow me as <a href="https://twitter.com/ryh1113">Aaron Elkins on Twitter</a> to help 
            spread the word.
        </p>

            Everything is still under construction, but if you are interested in the PEP code,
